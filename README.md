Human AI Teaming testbeds

## Blocks World for Teams (BW4T)

Blocks World for Teams (**BW4T**) is a testbed EIS environment for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.
