Human AI Teaming testbeds

## Blocks World for Teams (BW4T)

Blocks World for Teams (**BW4T**) is a testbed EIS environment for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.

## CREW: Platform for Human-AI Teaming

CREW is a platform designed to facilitate Human-AI teaming research, engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis.

## T2D Human-AI Robot Teaming testbed

The T2D Human-AI Robot Teaming testbed is a testbed for Human-AI Robot Teaming. The environment is designed in 3D with urban search and rescue in emergency environment. The robot can controlled with Wizard of Oz interface. ([source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610978.3640649)).
