# CREW Human-AI Teaming testbed

![CREW environment](docs/crew.png "Title")

CREW is a platform designed to facilitate Human-AI teaming research, engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis.

This platform supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, macOS prebuilt game environments does not work and will need to be rebuilt.
